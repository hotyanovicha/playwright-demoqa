# Development Guidelines

## Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)

### ⚠️ DO NOT OVERENGINEER

This project should focus on **practical, working solutions** rather than enterprise-level complexity.

### For DemoQA Elements Testing:

- Basic page object with essential selectors
- Simple navigation methods
- Clear, readable test cases
- Focus on functionality, not architecture

### Red Flags (Stop and Simplify):

- ❌ Creating multiple utility classes upfront
- ❌ Complex inheritance hierarchies
- ❌ Over-abstracted configuration
- ❌ Testing every possible edge case initially
- ❌ Building for "future requirements" 

### Green Lights (Good to Go):

- ✅ Direct, working solutions
- ✅ Clear, readable code
- ✅ Focused on current requirements
- ✅ Easy to understand and modify
- ✅ Gets the job done efficiently

**Remember: Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship working code first.**
